#####################################################################################
# The proposed model integrates carbon cycling and fire dynamics to simulate the
# carbon budget using a mechanistic approach inspired by Akihiko Ito (2005).
# The carbon cycle model consists of multiple carbon pools, capturing biomass accumulation, 
# decomposition, and post-fire regrowth. The carbon pool, particularly the vegetation will 
# be ecosystem specific if  this model expanded to eco-region or global scale. 
# The fire regime model simulates fire ignition, spread, and extinction  based on mechanistic principles, 
# explicitly modeling fire behavior as a function of plant traits, vegetation arrangement and weather condition, insipred by
# Zylstra 2016 and 2018. This approach incorporates deterministic processes governing fire dynamics and fuel consumption 
# including the fire occurence probability similarto Filipe Catry (2007). The interaction between 
# the carbon and fire models allows for feedback mechanisms, where fuel availability influences fire intensity, 
# and fire events regulate carbon fluxes through biomass burning, emissions, and post-fire vegetation recovery.
# This framework provides a process-based understanding of the role of fire in shaping carbon dynamics under changing 
# environmental conditions.
