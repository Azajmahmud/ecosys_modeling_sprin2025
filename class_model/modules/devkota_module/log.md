This is the log file where i enter the weekly updates to my module

## March 4 2025

current state of the module:

I identified the key processes and fluxes to be incorporated in my module and created a rough framework for the module. I updated the function with a few new inputs and outputs. At this point i still have fixed values for the potential parameters. I will update them each week.


Papers I read:

Wang, G., Post, W.M. and Mayes, M.A. (2013), Development of microbial-enzyme-mediated decomposition model parameters through steady-state and dynamic analyses. Ecological Applications, 23: 255-272. https://doi.org/10.1890/12-0681.1

goals for the upcoming week:

I will start looking for the specific equations and parameters values needed for the module. Hopefully, by the end of the next i will be able to refine the function with more details.
