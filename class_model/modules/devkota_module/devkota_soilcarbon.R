# Title: soil carbon module for carbon cycle
# Author: Pawan Devkota

# This module incorporate different fractions of soil carbon, processes associated
# with carbon input, and conversion between fractions, and major fluxes of carbon 
# from the soil to carbon cycle model. Soil carbon will be divided into labile or
# unprotected fractions and recalcitrant or protected fraction. The  labile 
# fraction include the carbon from microbes (microbial biomass carbon), and easily 
# decomposible plant residues (low C:N ratio). The recalcitrant fraction includes
# carbon derived from residues with high C:N ratio, also carbon protected within
# the clay complex are included under recalcitrant fraction (higher clay % in the
# soil indicates greater protection from microbial decomposition). Decomposition 
# is driven by soil microbes, and soil aggregation plays an important role in
# protecting labile carbon from microbial access. Fungi have ability to decompose 
# high C:N residues. Therefore, high fungi/bacteria ratio may promote decomposition
# of stable carbon from soil. Decomposition of both labile and recalcitrant carbon
# releases C to atmosphere as CO2.
#  
# In managed ecosystem (e.g., agricultural soil), cultivation practice like 
# tillage break down the soil aggregates, thereby accelerating soil carbon loss 
# due to exposure of protected C to microbial decomposition. Therefore, crop 
# management practices such as no-till, residue retention,crop rotation, and 
# cover cropping can help to stabilize the soil aggregates as well as provide 
# additional carbon input. Crop rotation, and cover crops also increase 
# below ground diversity which can change carbon turnover rate from the soil.
# i also intend to include those management strategies in my soil carbon module.
