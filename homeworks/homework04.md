# Homework 4
To continue approaching our class goal of creating a collective terrestrial ecosystem model,
we will make sure that everyone is comfortable collaborating using Git and GitHub.

1. Switch to the branch you created for Homework 3

2. Navigate to the [../class_model/modules](../class_model/modules) folder

3. Create a folder in the [../class_model/modules](../class_model/modules) titled
[last_name]_module

4. Navigate to the folder you created in the previous step and create a R script
titled [last_name]_[title] where title is a description of your module

5. In your R script created in the previous step, add a header with a title and your
name as the author (commented out)

6. In the same R script, add a description of your module. This might include the purpose of your
module, possible inputs needed, and likely outputs created. If you have a previous model
you might work from, please note it here. Add as much detail as you can.

7. Push your changes to your branch and create a pull request to pull your branch into the main
branch on gitHub.

The assignment is due by the start of next class period.
