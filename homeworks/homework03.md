# Homework 2
To continue approaching our class goal of creating a collective terrestrial ecosystem model,
we will make sure that everyone is comfortable using  Git and GitHub.

1. (if necessary) Download Git to your machine
	- if on Windows, I would recommend you also download Git bash

2. (if necessary) Create a folder to house your Git-enabled repositories
	- Tip: I create a folder in my Documents folder within my home drive called Git
	(e.g., '/Users/nicksmith/Documents/Git/')

3. (if necessary) Creat a GitHub account on [github.com](github.com)

4. Clone the class repository into your folder created in the previous prompt

5. Create a branch of the class repository titled '[your_last_name]_branch'

6. Add your name and information to the readme file in your branch

7. Add, commit, and push your changes to your branch

8. Create a pull request on GitHub to the main branch

9. Raise an issue on GitHub to flag that your pull request was made

The assignment is due by the start of next class period.
