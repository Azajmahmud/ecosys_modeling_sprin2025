# Homework 5
To continue approaching our class goal of creating a collective terrestrial ecosystem model,
we will make sure that everyone is comfortable creating functions in R.

1. Switch to the branch you created for Homework 3

2. Open the R script you created in Homework 4

3. Create a function for a simple process that you feel might be necessary for your module
within this R script
	- heavily comment this function to allow the reader to fully understand the intent
	of the function, options, and equations
	- set default values for any inputs and parameters such that the function can
	be run without defining any options
	- in comments, note any outstanding flaws with the function that you feel should be
	addressed with future development

4. Push your changes to your branch and create a pull request to pull your branch into the main
branch on gitHub.

The assignment is due by the start of next class period.
