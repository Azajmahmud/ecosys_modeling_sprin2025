# Homework 1
To begin approaching our class goal of creating a collective terrestrial ecosystem model,
we will start by building out the terrestrial ecosystem carbon cycle.

As a class, create a list of pools and fluxes that define the terrestrial
carbon cycle in a Word doc. You can work on this collaboratively at this url:

Using boxes (pools) and arrows (fluxes), piece all of your pools and fluxes together in a Powerpoint doc.
