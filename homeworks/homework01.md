# Homework 1
To begin approaching our class goal of creating a collective terrestrial ecosystem model,
we will start by building out the terrestrial ecosystem carbon cycle.

1. Create a list of pools and fluxes that you think are critical for defining the terrestrial
carbon cycle in an electronic document. Describe your rationale for why you have chosen this list.

2. Using boxes (pools) and arrows (fluxes), piece all of your pools and fluxes together in a Powerpoint doc.

When completed, email both documents to [Nick](emailto:nick.smith@ttu.edu).

The assignment is due by the start of next class period.
