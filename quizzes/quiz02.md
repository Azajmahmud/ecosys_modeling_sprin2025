# Quiz 2

1. What is net ecosystem productivity (NEP) and how is gross primary productivity (GPP),
autotrophic respiration (Ra), and heterotrophic respiration (Rh) involved?

2. Name at least 5 places carbon can go (i.e., carbon pools) after it is assimilated from the
atmosphere by terrestrial ecosystems.
Of these, what do you think the largest pool is for a natural West Texas ecosystem and why?

3. Name at least 5 places nitrogen can go (i.e., nitrogen pools) after it is assimilated from the
atmosphere by terrestrial ecosystems.
Of these, what do you think the largest pool is for a natural West Texas ecosystem and why?

4. How does organic matter decomposition connect terrestrial carbon and nitrogen cycles?
