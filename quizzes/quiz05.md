# Quiz 5

1. What does parsimony mean in ESMs?

2. Predicting ecosystem processes from traits is considered the Holy Grail in trait-based 
ecological studies. If you had to choose a single plant trait, which one do you think is 
the most important for predicting climate-vegetation interactions in the context of 
climate change, and why?

3. Why would we still study a process that does not have a significant influence on 
climate at large spatiotemporal scales?

4. What are the key steps involved in integrating a new process into an Earth System Model (ESM)?

We will work on this quiz at the beginning of class (~15 minutes).
